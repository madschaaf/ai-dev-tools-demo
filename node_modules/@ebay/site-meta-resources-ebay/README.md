# @ebay/site-meta-resources-ebay

The module contains site metadata and typescript definitions and is decoupled from @ebay/site-meta-ebay module to allow frequent updates without the need to publish code modules.

It is installed as part of dependency and used by @ebay/site-meta-ebay and it should be avoided to be used directly.

## Release process

* Fork repository
* Update metadata in resources folder
* Create a PR and make sure it is released after it is merged.
* Make sure the same changes are made to raptor framework

## Usage

```ts
import { EbaySiteNameEnum, EbaySiteIdEnum } from '@ebay/site-meta-resources-ebay';

const siteName = EbaySiteNameEnum.EBAY_US;
const siteNameEnum = EbaySiteNameEnum[siteName];
const siteNameEnum2 = EbaySiteNameEnum['EBAY_US'];

const siteId = EbaySiteIdEnum.EBAY_US;
const siteIdEnum = EbaySiteIdEnum[siteId];
const siteIdEnum2 = EbaySiteIdEnum[0];
const siteIdEnum3 = EbaySiteIdEnum['0'];
```
