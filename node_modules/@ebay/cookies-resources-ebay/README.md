# @ebay/cookies-resources-ebay

The module contains cookies metadata only and is decoupled from @ebay/cookies-ebay module to allow frequent updates without the need to publish code modules.

It is installed as part of dependency and used by @ebay/cookies-ebay and it should be avoided to be used directly.

## Release process

* Fork repository
* Update cookie metadata in resources folder
* Create a PR and make sure it is release after it is merged.
* Make sure the same changes are made to [raptor framework](https://github.corp.ebay.com/KERNEL/CookieUtils/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ebay/application/kernel/cookie/metadata/CookieMetadataEnum.java)
